Create a simple test automation framework from scratch for the login page of `https://account.we-connect.io/login` using your preferred programming language and Selenium (e.g., Selenium + Java/Python or Cypress). The framework should include:

- Page Object Model (POM) implementation.
- Test data management using external files (e.g., CSV, JSON, or Excel).
- TestNG or PyTest integration for test execution.
- Test reporting using any reporting tool (e.g., Extent Reports, Allure).
